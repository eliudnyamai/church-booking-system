# CHURCH BOOKING SYSTEM
 This is a church booking system made in respense to kenya's government directive of 100 people per church service.
 This is due to the current COVID19 pandemic. The system allows the admin to upload as many church services as possible
 and the system will automatically create an extra one when all the available sessions are full.
 It strictly limits a session to 100 people
